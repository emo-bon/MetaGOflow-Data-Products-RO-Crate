# MetaGOflow-Data-Products-RO-Crate
 This RO-Crate contains the results and metadata for the analysis of 1 raw sequence data sample (i.e. 1 sequence result (shotgun sequencing reaction) from 1 DNA sample from 1 sampling event at 1 site) using the MetaGOflow workflow, and itâ€™s associated metadata. These will be primary data input to the FE VRE.
